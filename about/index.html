<h1>{{ page.title }} Ravs</h1>

<p>Ravi Shankar is a Computer Science graduate pursuing Master of Science in Computer Science
at Arizona State University. On web, he likes to go by <i>ravs</i>.</p>

<p>He is a programmer, theatre enthusiast, and an avid swimmer. He speaks a little German (ein bisschen Deutsch) and always tries to show off which irritates his friends. He is a quick learner and believes in
learning something new everyday (at least he tries to do so). He believes the beauty of Computer Science lies in its practicality and ubiquitous presence, and he is proud of being a Computer Science Major.</p>

<p>Before joining ASU in Fall 2013, he completed his undergraduate in Computer Science from Bangalore Institute of Technology, Bangalore which is affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum. He was topper in his class in his freshman year. He did internship in Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Ltd in his final semester March-August 2009. In January 2010, he joined IBM Software Labs as an Associate Software Developer. He worked on various projects which were part of WebSphere suite of products. Before leaving IBM in June 2013, he was working as Software Developer and was SME for DB Connector, cloud based connectivity provided by CastIron Systems.</p>

<p>He aspires to be an Entrepreneur and keeps looking for that one elusive idea which has the power that would make him give up everything in order to make it happen. He applied to YC Summer 2013, but the idea was not strong enough to be accepted (thats what he thinks, YC Panel do not provide you the reason for rejection).</p>

<p>From busy class schedule he takes out time for other activities as well. He is an active member of NLP Reading group led by <a href="http://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/ponbarry/">Prof. Heather Pon-Barry</a>. He is a Member of <a href="https://orgsync.com/18459/chapter">Maroon And Gold Ambassador</a>, a group run by volunteers to organize events, like Passport to ASU, Club Carnival e.t.c.</p>
