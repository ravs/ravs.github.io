<p>Ravi Shankar is a self-driven, motivated and inspiring software developer. Eternal desire to <i>learn</i> and <i>lead</i> makes him unique and separates him from the others. He holds a Master of Computer Science degree in Computer Science, from Arizona State University. On web, he likes to go by <i>ravs</i>.</p>

<p>He prefer calling himself an artist, because he thinks everybody is an artist and we all are creating some kind of art. His art falls under the category of softwares and web technologies. He speaks a little German (ein bisschen Deutsch) and always tries to show off which irritates his friends. He is a quick learner and believes in learning something new everyday (at least he tries to do so). He believes the beauty of Computer Science lies in its practicality and ubiquitous presence, and he is proud of being a Computer Science Major.</p>

<p>In Summer 2014, he interned at Amazon.com Inc. in Seattle, WA. He worked with Prime Pantry team which was launched in <a href="http://consumerist.com/2014/04/24/amazon-prime-members-can-now-shop-for-groceries-with-addition-of-pantry-service/" target="_blank">April 2014</a>. He developed a real time order dashboard which got recognized by <a href="https://code.org/about/leadership/jeff_wilke" target="_blank">Jeff Wilke</a>, Senior Vice President of Consumer Business, Amazon.com Inc.</p>

<p>Before joining ASU in Fall 2013, he completed his undergraduate (Bachalor of Engineering in Computer Science &amp; Engineering) with <i>First Class</i> from Bangalore Institute of Technology, Bangalore which is affiliated to Visvesvaraya Technological University, Belgaum. He was topper in his class in his freshman year. He did internship in Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Ltd in his final semester March-August 2009. In January 2010, he joined IBM Software Labs as an Associate Software Developer. He worked on various projects which were part of WebSphere suite of products. Before leaving IBM in June 2013, he was working as Software Developer and was SME for DB Connector, cloud based connectivity provided by CastIron Systems.</p>

<p>He aspires to be an Entrepreneur and keeps looking for that one elusive idea which has the power that would make him give up everything in order to orchestrate it. He applied to YC Summer 2013, but the idea was not strong enough to be accepted (thats what he thinks, YC Panel do not provide you the reason for rejection).</p>

<p>From busy class schedule he takes out time for other activities as well. He <span style="text-decoration: line-through">is</span> was an active member of NLP Reading group led by <a href="http://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/ponbarry/" target="_blank">Prof. Heather Pon-Barry</a> (Prof. Pon-Barry moved to Mount Holyoke College).
