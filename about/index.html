I am Ravi Shankar. On web, I like to be called ravs. I am a Computer Science graduate, graduated from Bangalore Institute of Technology, Bangalore in year 2009.

I am a programmer, theatre enthusiast and an avid swimmer.

During my final semester, I did internship in Wipro Technologies and Robert Bosch. Both the projects were entirely differnet from other and provided me with great opportunity to learn.

In January 2010, I joined IBM Software Labs as Associate Software Engineer. While I was in IBM, I worked on JCA connectors/adapters, Cast Iron Connectors and couple of front end projects. I was also the part of team which won "So You Think You Can Innovate" (IBM internal challenge for innovation) for year 2012. Last year I won UI Challenge for Mobile Game. I am serving notice period and 17th June 2013 will be my last day at IBM.
